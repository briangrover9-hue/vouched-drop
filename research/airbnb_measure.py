"""Measures how bunched Airbnb guest ratings are in San Francisco and New York City.

Method: download Inside Airbnb's detailed "listings.csv.gz" snapshot for each
city, keep the listings that carry a numeric review_scores_rating (Airbnb's own
displayed aggregate rating, as scraped by Inside Airbnb; a listing only gets
one once it has at least one review), and compute the shape
of that distribution: mean, median, percentiles, the share sitting at various
high thresholds, and a histogram in steps of 0.01 from 1.00 to 5.00. Every
statistic is computed twice: once for all rated listings, and once restricted
to number_of_reviews >= 10, since a single five-star review can hand a brand
new listing a perfect 5.00 and skew the tail. The same statistics are also
computed for the two cities pooled together. Sub-scores (accuracy,
cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, value) get a median and a
share >= 4.8, for the >= 10-reviews group only.

Snapshot dates used below were confirmed by reading
https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ on 2026-09-27: San Francisco and New
York City were both last compiled on 14 June 2026. Both files are the
"Detailed Listings data" (listings.csv.gz), not the smaller visualization
summary (listings.csv).

Historical snapshots: older dated paths on data.insideairbnb.com, found in
Wayback Machine copies of the get-the-data page (2015-11-01, 2017-07-02,
2019-07-08, 2021-12-04 and 2023-03-06 for both cities), all returned HTTP 403
when tested on 2026-09-27. The raw files are no longer served, so this script
measures one snapshot and makes no claim about change over time.

Running this script takes no arguments. It downloads (or reuses previously
downloaded copies of) both listings files into RAW_DIR, computes the metrics
below, and writes them to data/airbnb.json next to this repo's research/
folder.
