# Sources ledger

Every number the page might use, where it comes from, and whether it passed. A number goes on the page only if its status is **Confirmed** (read in the primary source) or it is labeled on the page for what it is. Checked September 26 to 27, 2026.

Status key: **Confirmed** means read in the primary source. **Secondary** means seen only in reporting about the source. **Cut** means it does not go on the page.

## Our own measurement

| Number | Value | Source | Status |

| Share rated 4.8 or higher | 60.6% (SF 73.0%, NYC 56.9%) | same | Confirmed |

| All rated listings, any review count | 27,448; median 4.88, mean 4.75; 87.6% at 4.5+, 62.8% at 4.8+ | same | Confirmed |
| Softest sub-score | "value", median 4.76, 40.2% at 4.8+ (10+ reviews) | same | Confirmed |

Older Inside Airbnb snapshots (2015 to 2023) are no longer served (HTTP 403 on 2026-09-27), so the page makes no claim about Airbnb ratings changing over time from this data.

| Same, for a worker's platform reputation score one standard deviation higher | $27.96 before, $46.24 in 2024 (65% more) | same, Table 2; the score is the platform's own ranking, built mostly from on-platform reputation and prior performance, and employers see the ranking but not the score (Section 2, footnotes 15 and 42) | Confirmed. The authors emphasize the fall in tailoring's value; the rise in reputation's value is our reading of their table, and the page says so. |

The authors note TripAdvisor "does not use a bilateral reviewing system" and suggest "individuals rate other individuals differently or more tactfully, than they rate firms such as hotels" (pp. 2 to 3); the page gives that as their suggestion. |

A "46.8% retaliation" figure reported to us could not be found in either draft and is cut. The paper does not measure the effect of eBay's 2008 change; the page must not imply it does. |
| Lab: blind feedback cut the correlation between the two sides' ratings | 0.680 to 0.411 | same, Table 4 | Confirmed (lab experiment, n = 192) |
| Employers who privately would definitely not rehire but publicly gave 4+ stars | 28.4% | Filippas, Horton and Golden, NBER w25857 | Confirmed |

## What predicts job performance

Operational validity for overall job performance. 1998 values from Schmidt and Hunter (1998), Psychological Bulletin 124(2), Table 1, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.262). Revised values from Sackett, Zhang, Berry and Lievens (2022), Journal of Applied Psychology 107(11), Table 3, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000994). All Confirmed.

| Method | 1998 | 2022 |
|---|---|---|
| Structured interviews | .51 | .42 |
| Job knowledge tests | .48 | .40 |
| Biographical data (1998) / empirically keyed biodata (2022) | .35 | .38 |
| Work sample tests | .54 | .33 |
| Cognitive ability tests | .51 | .31 |
| Integrity tests | .41 | .31 |
| Unstructured interviews | .38 | .19 |
| Conscientiousness | .31 | .19 |
| Job experience (years) | .18 | .07 |
| Peer ratings | .49 | not re-estimated |
| Reference checks | .26 | not re-estimated |
| Years of education | .10 | not re-estimated |

Why each value changed, from Sackett et al. (2022), pp. 22 to 23. Revised range restriction corrections are the main driver for cognitive ability (.51 to .31), unstructured interviews (.38 to .19), structured interviews (.51 to .42, which also adds a new meta-analysis) and job knowledge (.48 to .40, a more current meta-analysis adjusted for an untrustworthy correction). Newer meta-analyses drive the rest: work samples (.54 to .33, "the result of a new meta-analysis", Roth et al., 2005, 54 studies, replacing Asher and Sciarrino's 1974 narrative review), integrity tests (.41 to .31, "Range restriction is not a significant factor"), conscientiousness (.31 to .19, "multiple new meta-analyses"), and experience (.18 to .07, "a new meta-analysis which focuses on prior work experience at point of hire"). The page gives both kinds of reason in plain words.

Caveats: Sackett et al. (2023, IOP 16(3)) revise cognitive ability again to .23 using an unpublished conference analysis. Oh, Le and Roth (2023, JAP 108(8)) and Bobko et al. (2024, IJSA 33(1)) dispute how much the 2022 paper lowers the estimates. Work samples show a larger Black-White gap (d = .67) than most methods in the same table.

## Costly signals

| Number | Value | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Two dating events at a South Korean dating company, 613 participants, each given 2 or 8 "roses": effect of attaching a rose on acceptance, all else equal | +3.3 percentage points, about a 20% increase (raw rates were 19.7% vs 23.6% for proposals to men and 12.3% vs 12.9% for proposals to women, which the authors call small) | Lee and Niederle (2015), "Propose with a Rose?", Experimental Economics 18, [PDF](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/Lee.Niederle.Rose.ExpEcon.2015.pdf), Section 4.3 | Confirmed. The page uses the 3.3 point estimate. Roses cost nothing to send: "roses are signals that everyone can send for free to anyone, and roses are costly only because they are in limited supply" (introduction), so the page calls them scarce, not costly. |
| Economics job market: each candidate may send 2 signals; a signal was associated with a higher chance of an interview | +6.8 percentage points (significant at 5%) | Coles, Cawley, Levine, Niederle, Roth and Siegfried (2010), Journal of Economic Perspectives 24(4), [PDF](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/JobMarket.JEP2010..pdf), Table 3 | Confirmed |

## Numbers that didn't survive

These widely repeated hiring statistics fell apart when traced. None of them is on the page; they are kept here as a record of what was checked and cut.

| Claim as usually repeated | What the source says | Source | Status |
